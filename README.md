Helmet Detection Model – Week 1 progress
🏍️ Automotive Helmet Detection using YOLOv8

This project aims to develop an automated helmet detection system using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The system identifies whether a bike rider is wearing a helmet or not, contributing to enhanced road safety and traffic rule enforcement.

📅 Week 1 – Project Initialization & Planning
🎯 Objectives

Finalize the project title and theme.

Understand the problem domain (helmet detection).

Explore existing research and tools for object detection.

Set up GitHub repository and local environment.
